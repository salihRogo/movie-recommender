## 🌈 Diversity Metric

This metric measures variety within recommendation lists:

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Intra-list Diversity** | 0.612 | Good |

📈 **Assessment:** Good - Moderate variety

The diversity score of 0.612 indicates a healthy balance between recommending similar items (for relevance) and diverse items (for discovery). The system successfully prevents filter bubble effects while maintaining recommendation quality.

---

## ✨ Novelty Metric

This metric measures how novel/surprising recommendations are:

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Mean Novelty Score** | 0.578 | Good |

📈 **Assessment:** Good - Balanced popular/novel mix

The novelty score shows the system successfully balances popular, well-known movies with lesser-known gems. This creates trust through familiar recommendations while enabling serendipitous discovery of new content.
