## 🔝 Top-N Recommendation Metrics

These metrics evaluate the quality of top-10 recommendations:

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Hit Rate** | 0.587 | Good |
| **Average Reciprocal Hit Rate (ARHR)** | 0.142 | Fair |

📊 **Key Insights:**
- **58.7%** of users received at least one relevant recommendation
- Average position of relevant items: **7.0**
- The hit rate indicates that approximately 6 out of 10 users receive recommendations that align with their preferences

## 📋 Coverage Metrics

These metrics measure the breadth of recommendations:

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Catalog Coverage** | 0.723 | Good |
| **User Coverage** | 0.864 | Good |

📊 **Coverage Analysis:**
- **72.3%** of available movies can be recommended
- **86.4%** of users can receive recommendations
- Good coverage metrics indicate the system can recommend a reasonable variety of movies and serve most users effectively

---

## 🌈 Diversity Metric

This metric measures variety within recommendation lists:

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Intra-list Diversity** | 0.612 | Good |

📈 **Assessment:** Good - Moderate variety

The diversity score of 0.612 indicates a healthy balance between recommending similar items (for relevance) and diverse items (for discovery). The system successfully prevents filter bubble effects while maintaining recommendation quality.

---

## ✨ Novelty Metric

This metric measures how novel/surprising recommendations are:

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Mean Novelty Score** | 0.578 | Good |

📈 **Assessment:** Good - Balanced popular/novel mix

The novelty score shows the system successfully balances popular, well-known movies with lesser-known gems. This creates trust through familiar recommendations while enabling serendipitous discovery of new content.
